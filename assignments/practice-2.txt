1.

a. 5 + 4 = 9 per

b. 9 * 1000 = 9000

c. 2*999 + 9 = 2007

d. sum lower times, eventually meeting memory. pipeline will slow down
no miss = 2 ns
1 cache miss = 7 ns
2 cache miss = 57 ns

2. 
A queue could allow the CPU to continue running while the CPU writes cache changes to memory.

3. 

A larger matrix will overflow the class.
