# Parallel Hardware
#### 2017-08-30

* GPU's can use SIMD parallelism though they are not pure SIMD systems because they have multiple cores
* GTX 1080 has 2560 CUDA cores
* If you take the whole GPU in mind, it uses MIMD, making it useful for parallel
* Processors may be connected by switches
* Rings and toroidal meshes also connect processors
* Toroidal meshes are a square with each row and column being a ring
