* This class will cover parallel programming
* Grading
  * 20% Midterm exam
  * 30% Final exam
  * 40% Homework
  * 10% Attendance
* All programming assignments must be demoed in class
* Chapters 1-2 are theory, will take 3 weeks
* After 3 weeks the class will be programming based
* This class will be based in C, need some based knowledge of C
* Using CygWin on Windows, can also use department server. gcc is fine on UNIX-based
* From 1986-2002 processors were increasing in performance quickly; from 2003 on they stagnated
* Serial programs only use one processor
* There are problems with creating faster processors relating to the size of transistors and heat management
* Running multiple instances of a serial program isn't always desirable
* Automatic conversion of serial programs to parallel programs has been attempted and been largely unsuccessful
* See slides for details
