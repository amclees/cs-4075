Pthreads - Shared Memory Programming

Different from MPI

Multiple threads in a single process, lighter weight than a new process

Doesn't work on Windows

Contained in pthread.h

pthread_t is the type for a pthread
When compiling don't forget -lpthread

Multiple arguments go in a struct which is passes with the void*

Without rejoining the threads most OS's terminate them after the main thread exits but it is not consistent

PThreads only need to know boundaries rather than using MPI_Scatter or other calls


Synchronization and Lock

Editing the same location at the same time is undefined

Boundaries given to threads must be given more though in PThreads
Race conditions are possible in PThreads

Use a mutex to restrict critical sections

Busy waiting is one method of mutual exclusion, but the thread does nothing until it's done waiting
pthread mutexes allow doing work while waiting
