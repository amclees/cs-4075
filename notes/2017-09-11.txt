Histogram Example Continued

Individual processors can find their own bin
Split data to two processors then add the arrays

Practice Problems 3

2.7 GPU vs. Vector processor

  A vector processor might run 100 iterations of the loop simultaneously
  Then it would continue by 100's

  A GPU could split the loop into two tasks run separately

2.10
  a.
    10^12 / 10^3 = 10^9 instructions
    10^9 instructions / 10^6 instructions per second = 10^3 seconds
    10^9 * (p - 1) messages * 10^-9 seconds / message = p - 1 seconds = 999 seconds
    10^3 + 999 seconds = 1999 seconds
  b.
    Same execution time of 10^3 seconds
    10^-3 seconds / message * 10^9 * (p - 1) messages = 10^6 * (p - 1) seconds = 10^6 * 999 seconds
    Total = 10^3 + 10^6 * 999 seconds ~= 32 years

  ring_links processors = processors
  # processors must be a perfect square
  toroidal_mesh_links processors = 2 * processors   
  crossbar_mesh_links processors = 2 * (p * (processors - 1))

The midterm is 2017-10-18
We will be going of pointers in C for review

Exam problems will be all based on the practice problems
There will be hand-written programming problems but they do not need to be bug free
